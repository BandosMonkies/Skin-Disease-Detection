# 🩺 Sparsha: Your Skin Health, Decoded by AI

**Sparsha** is an advanced dermatological screening platform designed to bridge the gap between AI-driven early detection and professional medical consultation. Developed as a group project during the **Machine Learning Workshop** hosted by **CIE, PES University**.

## 🚀 Overview

Skin conditions often go untreated due to lack of awareness or delayed access to specialists. **Sparsha** (meaning "Touch") makes skin health monitoring accessible. By combining high-accuracy CNN models with **Explainable AI (XAI)**, we ensure that our diagnosis isn't just a prediction, but a transparent process that users can trust.

### 📊 Key Performance Metrics
* **70% Accuracy Rate:** Driven by medical-grade datasets.
* **23+ Skin Conditions:** Capable of detecting a wide spectrum of dermatological issues.
* **24/7 Availability:** Instant analysis anytime, anywhere.
